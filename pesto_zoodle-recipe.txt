Serving size: 1

Ingredients:
 - 2 zucchini (green or yellow)
 - 2 Tbsp pesto sauce
 - parmesan cheese
 - olive oil
 - chorizo / italian sausage

 Directions:
  1. Fry some spicy sausage and keep to the side or cook parallel to the zucchini pasta (zoodles). One pound of sausage can go a long way, I meal prep so I fry a pound and spread the love.

  2.  Cut the ends off the zucchini and peel until you hit the core (core is too wet and leads to mushy noodles) using a peeler (for fettucini) or spiralizer (for spaghetti).

  3. Heat olive oil in a pan and saute the zucchini until the noodles soften (2-4 min).  If it is mushy, you have failed.

  4. While the zucchini is cooking, add the pesto and mix it in.

  5. Sprinkle parmesan cheese on top and turn off the heat.

  6. Add the sausage on top and enjoy.
